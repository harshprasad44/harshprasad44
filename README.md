- 👋 Hi, I’m @harshprasad44
- 👀 I am a Web Developer, especially a FrontEnd Web Developer, but I can work as a BackEnd developer too. It's just that I find FrontEnd more suitable for me. MERN Stack is something I love the most. Apart from that, I also work with Angular and Vue.js.
- 🌱 I’m currently preparing for my University placements.
- 💞️ I’m also looking to collaborate on projects.
- 📫 Drop me a mail @ explorerharsh@gmail.com
